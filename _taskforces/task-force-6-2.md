title: "OSIPI Task Force 6.2: DCE/DSC Challenges"
aims: Develop and implement challenges involving DCE/DSC perfusion imaging analysis
description: |
  To compare quantification pipelines for DSC/DCE-MRI in clinical cancer imaging applications. Through these challenges, the performance of DSC-/DCE-MRI perfusion analysis tools developed in-house by the participating groups or the available software packages will be tested and evaluated according to some metrics (eg. bias and precision on DROs, agreement with reference methods in-vivo, reproducibility on in-vivo data, processing time, etc). The contestants are encouraged to use the software tools listed in OSIPI in creating their pipelines. The aim of this task force is to establish a set of benchmarks for perfusion imaging in different applications.
