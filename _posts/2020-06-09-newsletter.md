By may 2022, OSIPI will have delivered 24 main deliverables including 13 peer-reviewed journal articles, 6 sustainable online resources, 1 manual, 3 software releases, and 1 standard amendment (DICOM). An estimated 16 abstracts will be submitted to ISMRM 2021 and 2022, and each task force will present at the perfusion study group workshop (currently foreseen for February 2022), as well as on the study group sessions at the annual meetings.

Full details on the deliverables and the trajectory towards them can be found in the [OSIPI roadmap 20-22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRbxX9ywttwQfd2hyj62h676RjEZ3YHZBIBTkUmEb2nqOmrRVd-PlWeL6nAsJ79akQpXHmtBIizJiOK/pub).
