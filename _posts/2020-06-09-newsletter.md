## June 6, 2020: Roadmap launched!

We have launched the first Roadmap for OSIPI! 

This formally kicks of the first delivery cycle which runs from may 2020 to may 2022. At the end of it, OSIPI will have delivered 24 main deliverables including 13 peer-reviewed journal articles, 6 sustainable online resources, 1 manual, 3 software releases, and 1 standard amendment (DICOM). An estimated 16 abstracts will be submitted to ISMRM 2021 and 2022, and each task force will present at the perfusion study group workshop (currently foreseen for February 2022), as well as on the study group sessions at the annual meetings.

Full details on the deliverables and the trajectory towards them can be found in the [OSIPI roadmap 20-22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRbxX9ywttwQfd2hyj62h676RjEZ3YHZBIBTkUmEb2nqOmrRVd-PlWeL6nAsJ79akQpXHmtBIizJiOK/pub). 

If you want to take part, you can join the effort at any time. Just get in touch with the appropriate [task force leads](https://www.osipi.org/emb/) and start a conversation.
