Dear all,

Apologies for the radio silence on our end, but we have all been working on building OSIPI into a sustainable initiative. First, we have formed task forces aimed at suuporting OSIPI's mission. Each task force now has two leads, and are actively recruiting participants to join and help out. Second, together with the task forces, we have all been working on a concrete 2 year (2020-2022) roadmap and are now excited to share it with you. By May 2022, OSIPI is planning on 24 main deliverables including 13 peer-reviewed journal articles, 6 sustainable online resources, 1 manual, 3 software releases, and 1 standard amendment (DICOM). We estimate 16 abstracts will be submitted to the annual ISMRM meetings in 2021 and 2022. Furthmore, as we wrap up the 2 year cycle, each task force will present at the ISMRM Perfusion study group workshop (currently planned for February 2022), as well as on the study group sessions at the annual meetings.

Full details on the deliverables and the trajectory towards them can be found in the [OSIPI roadmap 20-22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRbxX9ywttwQfd2hyj62h676RjEZ3YHZBIBTkUmEb2nqOmrRVd-PlWeL6nAsJ79akQpXHmtBIizJiOK/pub). 

You are welcome to join the effort at any time! Just get in touch with the appropriate [task force leads](https://www.osipi.org/emb/) or myself (s.sourbron@sheffield.ac.uk), Laura (laura.bell@barrowneuro.org), Henk-Jan (henkjanmutsaerts@gmail.com) to start a conversation. 

Next up, we're trying to find a time for a virtual meeting since we will not be able to meet in person this year at ISMRM. Stayed tuned for updates. 

Looking forward to colloborating with you all,
Steven, Laura, and Henk-Jan
