Dear colleagues,

All task forces in OSIPI have successfully delivered their first milestones! This is a major step and puts us firmly on track to deliver our main aims in a timely manner. Some of the task forces will communicate separately in more detail, but here are the highlights:

**Task force 1.1 (ASL software inventory)** has created an online questionnaire for ASL developers who have built their own ASL analysis pipelines. The survey will form the basis for the inventory of ASL pipelines that will be published and maintained by the task force. 

See [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-4_pBXFA31htMNPZo1kQgcY0EJ5_AWxjyvkkYIQVGUHo6sg/viewform) for more details.

**Task force 1.2 (DSC/DCE software inventory)** has created a list of available DSC/DCE software, including both commercial and open-source tools, with links. If you know of any relevant software packages that are missing from the list, please contact the task force co-lead [Melissa Prah](mailto:mprah@mcw.edu).

The list can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14avwqgQv6l0Uw7xExz9P0w-rwwY-e2cA/view). 

**Task force 2.1 (Library structure and management)** is currently finalising the outline of the library specifications document that will form the basis for ASL, DCE and DSC software libraries. 

**Task force 2.2 (ASL software contributions)** has prepared a scope document for their code collection with details about the functionality, programming languages, testing capabilities, code harmonization, documentation, and the publication. A call for contributions will go out before the end of august. 

Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ioVbJKTfeoIGwCYcq6IsWwl9o_W4wRfeSFHXo6msCQQ/edit#) for details. 

**Task force 2.3 (DSC/DCE software contributions)** has prepared a scope document for their code collection with details about the targeted functionality, software languages for v1.0 of the DSC/DCE Library as well as the general approach to collection, verification and harmonization of code. 

Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmGhdzUPREHjpGtSEQohmIYz1Fi-XmHm0R8_Qp8xCuI/edit#heading=h.qbn3y9arw2jn) for details. 

**Task force 3.1 (DRO's and phantoms)** has created a questionnaire where developers of DRO's can provide details on the DRO's that they may be able/willing to make freely available to the community. The responses will form the basis for the inventory of DRO's to be built by task force 3.1.

If you would like to contribute a DRO to the inventory, please complete the survey [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds0Ao-jAHrljckEBndGBnkAmOmkB1-YSdAHjFCDZijOS1ghw/viewform) 

**Task force 3.2 (Clinical and preclinical data)** has built a publicly available list of repositories that contain perfusion data. The inventory contains URLs to the repositories, and their most pertinent characteristics, such as the review process, types of data that are supported by the repository, etc. 

Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CF-Vvii6IUWf-ZUbmDUhgCf2RXAxtw4E4kIGO_HQWKY/edit#gid=1936606832) for details. 

**Task force 4.1 (ASL lexicon)** has compiled comprehensive lists of standard ASL acquisition protocol parameters and output parameters (derivatives). Our primary aim is to achieve a community consensus for ASL sequence parameter naming and definitions. Therefore, we are very happy to receive feedback and input from anyone with an active interest in the field. Please get in touch with the co-lead [Yuriko Suzuki](mailto:yuriko.suzuki@eng.ox.ac.uk)

Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj0Tp4yur4dpJntF90yy2bOBUx33FG-w/edit) for details. 

**Task force 4.2 (DCE/DSC lexicon)** has completed a first full version of the Lexicon for internal consultation including an optimised structure, update of introductions/discussion and references, and missing sections. 

Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OwzpbuMDrbCQZaN0p9_kyK8dTWu2VHaaU_wsQAP4C4/edit#heading=h.pto97fttpbsb) for details. 

**Task force 6.1 (ASL challenges)** has completed a draft paper describing the challenge in detail, including a brief literature review on current practices, and the metrics that the challenge outcome will be measured against. The draft paper will be distributed to collect feedback before finalising the design.

Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EtG5TVZotnvXSufboh707lAIq1imPg2CTVaMnIN01iA/edit) for details.

**Task force 6.2 (DSC/DCE challenges)** has drafted the challenge outline including submission formats and specific guidelines, evaluation metrics and data to be used, etc. The draft document is publicly available and open to feedback before the design is finalised. Please contact the task force lead [Anahita Fathi](mailto:Anahita.Fathikazerooni@pennmedicine.upenn.edu) for any suggestions or queries.
