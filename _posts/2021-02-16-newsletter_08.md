Update on OSIPI Milestones and Deliverables due in February 2021 (IN PROGRESS)

---

**Task force 1.1 (ASL software inventory)** has produced its first deliverable! An ASL pipeline inventory was created and published online referencing the majority of ASL pipeline developers. The inventory provides basic information about pipeline requirements and features, and should serve as a quick guide helping new users to select an appropriate tool for ASL data processing.

**Task Force 2.2 (ASL code contributions)** has received detailed code from ASL_TBX with extensive functionalities and from ASL Angio Reader with several functionalities. The task force members reviewed the collected code and the functionalities are listed in the database [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ZBAY8rfqUR7EWlPgI5POp6GvFizC4mC/edit#gid=1251552107) and the collected code is available in the repository [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M1RQnXVzZljfowmuA8sZqb3Fh7MlIq1Y).

**Taskforce 2.3 (DCE/DSC code contributions)** has added further open-source Python code to its [collection](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection) and documented [procedures](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection/tree/develop/doc) for contributors to add further [code](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection/blob/develop/doc/code_contributions_record.csv). A call for contributions has been made to the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group. Our focus now moves to testing of code contributions, which will ultimately be used to create an integrated OSIPI code library

**Task force 3.2 (Clinical and preclinical data)** has completed its first deliverable - an inventory (list) of publicly available perfusion datasets along with a tabulated list of descriptors for each dataset. Public feedback is invited and encouraged, and collected systematically.

---

**Task force 4.1 (ASL lexicon)** has compiled comprehensive lists of the physiological constant and parameters required for quantification. Our primary aim is to achieve a community consensus for naming and definitions in ASL quantification. Therefore, we are very happy to receive feedback and input from anyone with an active interest in the field.

---

**TF6.2 (DCE/DSC Challenges)** has prepared the design of the challenge and submitted an abstract on the challenge design to the annual meeting of the ISMRM. The TF members have tested and prepared the clinical data to be used and the DRO is in development. We are delighted to announce that, if the abstract is accepted, this challenge will run as a formal an ISMRM Challenge.
