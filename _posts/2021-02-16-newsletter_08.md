Update on OSIPI Milestones and Deliverables due in February 2021 (IN PROGRESS)

**Task force 1.1 (ASL software inventory)** has produced its first deliverable! An ASL pipeline inventory was created and published online referencing the majority of ASL pipeline developers. The inventory provides basic information about pipeline requirements and features, and should serve as a quick guide helping new users to select an appropriate tool for ASL data processing.

**Task force 3.2 (Clinical and preclinical data)** has completed its first deliverable - an inventory (list) of publicly available perfusion datasets along with a tabulated list of descriptors for each dataset. Public feedback is invited and encouraged, and collected systematically.
