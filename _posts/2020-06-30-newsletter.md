Dear colleagues,

We are excited to announce that the editor of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, Prof. Peter Jezzard, has offered to publish the main deliverables of OSIPI together as a special section in a future issue of the journal, and additionally as a [virtual issue](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15222594/homepage/virtual_issues.htm). As you know Magnetic Resonance in Medicine is at the forefront of a movement to [promote reproducible science in MRI research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.27939), and this is also central to the mission of OSIPI . 

The collection of papers will have a submission deadline of 1 May 2022, which is timed to align with the due date of some key deliverables as stated in the [OSIPI roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRbxX9ywttwQfd2hyj62h676RjEZ3YHZBIBTkUmEb2nqOmrRVd-PlWeL6nAsJ79akQpXHmtBIizJiOK/pub). We expect to submit 11-12 papers to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, including user-based reviews of processing pipelines, classification and comparisons of contributed code, inventory and sharing guidelines for digital reference objects and open-access perfusion data, reporting guidelines and formats, challenges and software validation. All papers submitted will be subjected to the standard review process of MRM and published only if they successfully pass peer review. 

OSIPI remains open for new contributors, and we would especially encourage junior investigators, post-docs, and PhD students to join in. It's a great opportunity to take part in an international collaboration that will shape the future of our field, and to get more out of your research by sharing your methods and results with others. Have a look at the different task forces and feel free to contact the task force leads if you are interested to help out.

Best wishes,
