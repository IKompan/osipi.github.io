Dear colleagues,

All task forces in OSIPI have successfully delivered their first milestones! This is a major step and puts us firmly on track to deliver our main aims in a timely manner. Some of the task forces will communicate separately in more detail, but here are the highlights:

**Task force 1.1 (ASL software inventory)** has created an online questionnaire for ASL developers who have built their own ASL analysis pipelines. The survey will form the basis for the inventory of ASL pipelines that will be published and maintained by the task force. See [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-4_pBXFA31htMNPZo1kQgcY0EJ5_AWxjyvkkYIQVGUHo6sg/viewform) for more details.

**Task force 1.2 (DSC/DCE software inventory)** has created a list of available DSC/DCE software, including both commercial and open-source tools, with links. The list can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14avwqgQv6l0Uw7xExz9P0w-rwwY-e2cA/view). If you know of any relevant software packages that are missing from the list, please contact the task force co-lead [Melissa Prah](mailto:mprah@mcw.edu).

**Other task forces** update will follow soon..

Best wishes,
