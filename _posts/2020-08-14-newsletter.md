Dear colleagues,

All task forces in OSIPI have successfully delivered their first milestones! This is a major step and puts us firmly on track to deliver our main aims in a timely manner. Some of the task forces will communicate separately in more detail, but here are the highlights:

**Task force 1.1 (ASL pipeline inventory)** has created an online questionnaire for ASL developers who have built their own ASL analysis pipelines. The survey will form the basis for the inventory of ASL pipelines that will be published and maintained by the task force. See here [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-4_pBXFA31htMNPZo1kQgcY0EJ5_AWxjyvkkYIQVGUHo6sg/viewform) for more details.

Best wishes,
