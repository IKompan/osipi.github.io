Dear colleagues,

The OSIPI task forces have completed a number of new milestones. Here are the summaries (**IN PROGRESS**):

**Task force 3.2 (Clinical and preclinical data)** prepared the initial list of the attributes that will accompany the public datasets that will be included in the inventory. This list is open to revisions based on the experience assembling the inventory, and suggestions from the community. We welcome community suggestions for the refinement of the proposed list. 

Please see [here](https://bit.ly/3823H2U) for details. 


Best wishes,
