Dear colleagues,

The OSIPI task forces have completed a number of new milestones. Here are the summaries (**IN PROGRESS**):

**Task Force 1.2 (DCE/DSC Inventory)** has completed their second milestone. A total of 48 descriptors have been added to the [dynamic contrast software inventory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14avwqgQv6l0Uw7xExz9P0w-rwwY-e2cA/view). These descriptors provide factual information encompassing software accessibility, support, implementation, and functionality, and also includes relevant publications specific to each tool. We are on track to complete our first deliverable in February, where all descriptors will be defined for each software tool.

**Taskforce 2.3 (DCE/DSC code contributions)** led by Michael Thrippleton and Petra van Houdt has completed Milestone 2 (milestone lead: Sudarshan Ragunathan). We have established a [Github repository](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection) for collecting DCE/DSC code in Python. At present the library contains code for T1 mapping, including automated unit testing and test coverage monitoring. We continue to refine the process for integration and testing of code contributions, and we will expand the range of DC functionality in future milestones. The repository provides tested, open-source code for researchers and developers, and will ultimately be used to create a single harmonised DCE/DSC code library in collaboration with task force 2.1.

**Task force 3.2 (Clinical and preclinical data)** has completed the description of [repositories that contain perfusion data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CF-Vvii6IUWf-ZUbmDUhgCf2RXAxtw4E4kIGO_HQWKY/edit#gid=1936606832) and has prepared an initial [list of the attributes](https://bit.ly/3823H2U) that will accompany the public perfusion datasets in the inventory. This list is open to revisions based on the experience assembling the inventory. We also welcome community suggestions for the refinement of the proposed list.

**Task force 4.1 (ASL lexicon)** has completed their second milestone: comprehensive lists of advanced ASL techniques and output parameters, including advanced ASL labeling strategies, multi-time-point ASL, vessel-selective ASL, ASL angiography and modified ASL methods for special derivatives.

**Task Force 4.2 (DCE/DSC lexicon)** has collected feedback from the OSIPI community on the Lexicon draft, incorporated comments and revised the structure of the Lexicon accordingly. Detailed tables of quantities have been extended and referred to separate sections. A formalism has been developed which enables encoding of descriptive pipelines using the items defined by the lexicon. For feedback please contact the [task force leads](https://www.osipi.org/task-force-4-2/).

**Task Force 6.1 (ASL challenge)** has developed a mature draft of the challenge design and completed data design. Population-based data are finalised and synthetic data preparation underway. An abstract on the challenge design will be submitted to ISMRM. It has also been decided the challenge will run as a use case for the redesign of the new ISMRM challenge format.

Best wishes,
