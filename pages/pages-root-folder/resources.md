OSIPI develops resources to facilitate research in perfusion imaging, improve research coordination and promote reproducible research. 

These resources are currently under development and feedback is welcome - please contact the responsible task force lead with your ideas and suggestions:

**DCE/DSC resources**
---
* **DCE/DSC software inventory** *In progress*  
A curated list of software packages for processing DCE & DSC data, compiled by [task force 1.2](/task-force-1-2/). Access the current draft [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14avwqgQv6l0Uw7xExz9P0w-rwwY-e2cA/view). 

* **DCE/DSC code library** *In progress*  
A curated library of code snippets for use in DCE & DSC processing pipelines, under construction by [task force 2.3](/task-force-2-3/). Access the github repository [here](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection

* **DCE/DSC lexicon** *In progress*    
Harmonized terminology for encoding DCE & DSC analysis pipelines, developed by [TF 4.2](/task-force-4-2/). See [DCE/DSC Lexicon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OwzpbuMDrbCQZaN0p9_kyK8dTWu2VHaaU_wsQAP4C4/edit#heading=h.pto97fttpbsb) for the current draft.

* **DCE challenge** *In progress*    
Design of challenge to run in 2021, developed by [TF 6.2](/task-force-6-2/). See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DXJsKwLrAeh471SLhlvEFaNtw-ePLZcBsxSzM8QJ_KM/edit?usp=sharing) for a draft on the design.

**ASL resources**
---
* **ASL software inventory** *In progress*  
A curated list of software packages for processing ASL data, compiled by [task force 1.1](/task-force-1-1/). Access the current draft [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LkYyjJP9XD-DMwcCeTZLKCzV_wDvbqgPOxUvhPvZjJA/edit#).     

* **ASL lexicon** *In progress*    
Harmonized terminology for encoding ASL acquisition and analysis pipelines, developed by [TF 4.1](/task-force-4-1/). Split up in a list of standard methods [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj0Tp4yur4dpJntF90yy2bOBUx33FG-w/edit) and a list of advanced methods [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XkNorUSN0-S5rXkz6NtcfgWedyxfOnHs/edit?dls=true).

* **ASL challenge** *In progress*    
Design of challenge to run in 2021, developed by [TF 6.1](/task-force-6-1/). See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BiTmOTJsAS4oh67Sb9VkdQxtCgdQNAZv6Z0R19wKTSY/edit) for current draft (embargoed until ISMRM deadline).

**Data and reference objects**
---
* **Perfusion data inventory** *In progress*    
A curated list of publicly available perfusion datasets and repositories, compiled by [TF 3.2](/task-force-3-2/). See [here](https://bit.ly/38AdEF6) for an inventory of perfusion data, and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CF-Vvii6IUWf-ZUbmDUhgCf2RXAxtw4E4kIGO_HQWKY/edit#gid=1936606832) for a list of repositories that contain perfusion data.
